## Divide and Conquer Algorithm
* It is a strategy of solving a large problem by:
  * Breaking the problem into sub-problems.
  * Solving the sub-problems.
  * Combining them to get the desired output.
* To use the divide and conquer algorithm, recursion is used.

## How divide and conquer algorithms work:
1. __Divide:__ Divide the given problem into sub-problems using recursion.
2. __Conquer:__ Solve the smaller sub problems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough then solve it directly.
3. __Combine:__ Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.
* For example: Sorting an array using divide and conquer approach(Merge sort). 
* Converting [7,6,1,5,4,3] to [1,3,4,5,6,7]
